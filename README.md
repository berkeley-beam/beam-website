# beam-website

## Getting started

To do dev work for the site, pull the repo to your local machine. You will then
need to install jekyll and bundler using the following commands:

```
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve

```

The `jekyll serve` command serves up a local instance of the site on port 4000.
Visit the instance in your browser at localhost:4000. If you need more in-depth
instructions, check out [jekyll's website](https://jekyllrb.com).

Update 3/26/2024: ^^^ This does NOT WORK!!!! You run into some dependency issues with gem and jekyll, so we suggest 
just pushing everything straight to master branch and seeing the changes live on the website :))))"

## Process

Please do not push straight to master. For now, let's try to do all work on branches
unless you have been approved to push straight to master. Make a PR if you want to
make a change, and if it is approved, it will be merged in to the site. This will
hopefully keep the website clean and functional.
