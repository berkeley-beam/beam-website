      <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: left; "> What would you consider to be hallmarks of a good mentor? How
        have you demonstrated those traits in your own mentoring? </h2>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        One hallmark of a good mentor is <b>the ability to adapt ones teaching style in order to meet the learning 
          needs of each individual student.</b> This means that a good mentor will utilize multiple techniques of 
        teaching, allowing them to cater to the different needs that they think their students will respond the best 
        to. While some students are able to absorb information well through lecturing, others are more visual learners. 
        Some students may be more hands-on, while others are more kinesthetic learners. Understanding how our mentees 
        learn and supporting them by teaching in a way that they will best respond to is so important, and BEAM has 
        allowed mentors to learn this hallmark skill. I believe I have demonstrated this trait throughout my years in BEAM. 
        If I notice certain students learn better visually or auditory, I use the opportunity to cater to their needs 
        by going to them separately, or spending more time on a module that utilizes those teaching styles. Additionally, 
        I have been able to modify the lesson so we use more of a certain style of teaching, as well as talk to each 
        of my mentors and <b>encourage them to use a teaching technique that our students tend to respond better to. </b>
        This hallmark trait of a good mentor is extremely important, and allows us as mentors to foster an inclusive 
        learning environment for our students where they can thrive and enjoy learning!

        As Cal students, it is well-known that we quickly become wrapped up in our own worlds, often oblivious to the 
        challenges that nearby underrepresented communities face daily. Although UC Berkeley is academically prestigious, 
        <b>educational inconsistencies within Oakland elementary and middle schools around the corner are prevalent.</b> I never 
        expected that I could help bridge these gaps as a BEAM mentor. Initially, I imagined the club would be a great way 
        to reignite the passion I had for tutoring and babysitting in high school, but it grew to be much more. BEAM has 
        opened my eyes to the changes Cal students can make on a child’s confidence in STEM education. Although we ran 
        experiments with the kids one day a week, I witnessed the positive effects of our mentorship firsthand. We investigated 
        toxicity in a game where ping-pong balls were transferred to represent bioaccumulation, spearheaded series versus 
        parallel circuits to practice physics, and recognized pitches and tones of acoustics through homemade harmonicas 
        with popsicle sticks, rubber bands and straws. <b>I expected to build connections with the kids, but I did not expect 
        that I could be a teacher in the classroom as well as a role model in their personal lives,</b> yet now, cannot imagine 
        anything less. BEAM IS AWESOME

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        One thing that I was surprised by this semester is <b> how much I can learn from new mentors.</b> Similar to
        mentees, its incredible how much you can learn from someone you initially expect to be teaching or guiding. All
        the mentors in my site have unique strengths when they teach and its very valuable to observe them and be able
        to incorporate those aspects in my teaching as well. I’ve learned through this semester that <b>being a good
          teacher is actually a constant learning process.</b> There are always things I can improve upon and a variety
        of ways I can convey a concept. It helps to be with a new site each semester because everyone brings something
        unique to the table and has their own strength that I can learn from and be inspired by.

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        This semester in BEAM, <b>I learned how big of an impact we truly have as mentors for these mentees.</b> There was one 
        mentee that really stood out to me, because I was able to see her skills and confidence skyrocket as the semester 
        progressed. She was really shy and quiet at the beginning of the semester, and had a difficult time engaging with 
        the other students. I tried helping her out by working with her one-on-one, asking her to help me out with certain 
        tasks. I wanted to make her feel seen and heard during the lessons. As we reached the end of the semester, I feel 
        like I really got to see her improvement. She started helping more with the activities and got more engaged. At one 
        of our last sites, she even gave the mentors a hug, and I feel like she really became a lot more comfortable with us 
        and with doing all the lessons. This interaction really made me realize <b>how important it is to make STEM accessible 
        to all students,</b> especially those who are a bit more shy. As I continue to teach more mentees in BEAM, I want to 
        make sure to always keep this experience in mind. That way, <b>I can continue my efforts to connect with mentees to 
        help them improve their confidence in STEM. </b>

  <a name="FAQ"></a>
  <h2 style="font-size: 2.0em; ">Frequently Asked Questions </h2>

  <div style="width:75%; display:inline-block;">
    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>What is the weekly time commitment? </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      We have mandatory DeCal (worth 1 or 2 units) on Monday evenings from 6:30-8pm, where we primarily go over the
      lesson for the week. You will then attend site for 1 hour (not including transportation time) on one afternoon
      between Tuesday and Friday every week! You are at the same site for the whole semester. Our Outreach committee
      also plans out volunteer events and socials that you can attend on weekends!
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>What if I have no teaching experience? </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Don’t worry at all! Our Mentor Development committee prepares a Mentor Orientation every semester to prepare you
      for teaching and situations in the classroom, as well as presentations and activities throughout the semester to
      help facilitate your growth as a mentor. Additionally, you attend site in a group of 4-6 mentors, including 1
      experienced site leader so there’s people that have your back!
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>How can I get to site if I don't have a car? </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"> Transportation is entirely covered by BEAM! Some schools are within walking distance
      and transportation will be provided for those that require driving. </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>Do I have to be a STEM major to be a mentor? </b></p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 5vh; text-align: left;">
      Absolutely not! We have very comprehensive lesson plans that you will read every week and that we go over during
      decal on Mondays to prepare you for site.
