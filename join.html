      <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: left; "> What would you consider to be hallmarks of a good mentor? How
        have you demonstrated those traits in your own mentoring? </h2>

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        One hallmark of a good mentor is <b> being able to ask questions that spur students to realize the answer rather
          than feeding them facts.</b> I would say I’m pretty good at that since a lot of the time my understanding is
        not perfect, so it’s not always the easiest thing to explain without being confusing (especially bio and chem
        modules). Instead, I ask them questions like “what do you think would happen if I do this” or “how do you think
        this is affected by that” or “can someone give me an example of this”. Then, if I want to make sure that
        everyone agrees, I’ll ask “who agrees with what he/she said.” If someone disagrees, then I’ll have them explain
        their logic, and that way I can <b> understand the thought process of the mentees better. </b> I’m then better
        equipped to give an example or another question to get everyone on the right page, and then I can generalize
        whatever concept we’ve “discovered” to the teaching goal in the module.

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        I found out about BEAM through Reddit, so coming in, I didn’t know what to expect. Berkeley was, and still is,
        very new to me, which <b> has made BEAM very influential in my growing idea of what it's really like to be a Cal
          student.</b> I like working with kids, and hope to go into teaching at some point in my career, so the
        opportunity to work in a classroom for an hour a day has been invaluable. What I definitely did not expect was
        the <b>sense of community</b> within BEAM—I had no idea that a decal could be a family, but I can’t think of any
        other way to describe you all. It’s really refreshing refreshing to be around people so dedicated and passionate
        about something so honorable and good every week. Everyone takes their job seriously, and I have a lot of
        respect for that.

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        One thing that I was surprised by this semester is <b> how much I can learn from new mentors.</b> Similar to
        mentees, its incredible how much you can learn from someone you initially expect to be teaching or guiding. All
        the mentors in my site have unique strengths when they teach and its very valuable to observe them and be able
        to incorporate those aspects in my teaching as well. I’ve learned through this semester that <b>being a good
          teacher is actually a constant learning process.</b> There are always things I can improve upon and a variety
        of ways I can convey a concept. It helps to be with a new site each semester because everyone brings something
        unique to the table and has their own strength that I can learn from and be inspired by.

      <!-- <img style="width:10vw; height:auto; position:absolute; margin:0px;"src="/images/icons/join4.png"></img> -->
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        The biggest takeaway that I have from this semester in BEAM is that <b>I should definitely be more patient with
          my failures and strive more for improvement rather than success the first time.</b> When I see the mentees in
        my class, I see a lot of who I used to be. Many times in elementary and high school, when I encountered concepts
        that I found to be too hard or too boring, I would lose interest in them, procrastinating assignments or even
        refusing to do them. Now that I am in college, I have realized that more and more concepts will be difficult and
        unfamiliar to me; however, repeating what I have done in the past when confronted with a challenge is a recipe
        for failure. Going to site every week and watching students deal with concepts they have never learned before,
        such as mechanics and computer science, has made me understand that <b> failing the first time I do something is
          an opportunity to learn something new instead of a roadblock.</b> It has also taught me patience—both in terms
        of patience with myself when learning new things, but also being patient with students who are struggling with
        the material.

  <h2 style="font-size: 2.0em; ">Frequently Asked Questions </h2>

  <div style="width:75%; display:inline-block;">
    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>How will BEAM be adapted for the Fall 2020 semester? </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Due to the exceptional circumstances caused by COVID-19, BEAM will operate remotely by recording and editing
      lesson videos that will then be shared with our affiliated sites. In addition, all mentors will be working on
      group-directed projects throughout the semester focused either on improving the educational experiences of our
      students or enhancing processes within BEAM. <br><br>
      We understand that this semester will look quite a bit different
      from those past, but as our mission to make STEM accessible to students of all socioeconomic backgrounds
      becomes more essential than ever, we would be thrilled if you would <a target=_blank
      href="https://www.facebook.com/beam.teach/">join us</a>.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>What is the weekly time commitment? </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      We have mandatory DeCal (worth 1 or 2 units) on Monday evenings from 6:30-8pm, where we primarily go over the
      lesson for the week. You will then attend site for 1 hour (not including transportation time) on one afternoon
      between Tuesday and Friday every week! You are at the same site for the whole semester. Our Outreach committee
      also plans out volunteer events and socials that you can attend on weekends!
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>What if I have no teaching experience? </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Don’t worry at all! Our Mentor Development committee prepares a Mentor Orientation every semester to prepare you
      for teaching and situations in the classroom, as well as presentations and activities throughout the semester to
      help facilitate your growth as a mentor. Additionally, you attend site in a group of 4-6 mentors, including 1
      experienced site leader so there’s people that have your back!
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>How can I get to site if I don't have a car? </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"> Transportation is entirely covered by BEAM! Some schools are within walking distance
      and transportation will be provided for those that require driving. </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>Do I have to be a STEM major to be a mentor? </b></p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 5vh; text-align: left;">
      Absolutely not! We have very comprehensive lesson plans that you will read every week and that we go over during
      decal on Mondays to prepare you for site.
