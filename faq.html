                <i>We want you to write an amazing application, so we've put together a guide 
                filled with what you should focus on when writing your responses. Remember, 
                the best opportunity you'll have to learn more about BEAM and our 
                application will stil be at our infosession, so don't forget to join us at

            <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>BEAM's Mission Statement is: To provide 
                accessible, hands-on STEM education to our local communities, with the 
                hopes of inspiring students of all backgrounds to pursue STEM. What about 
                this statement motivates you personally to join BEAM? Choose at least one 
                specific word or phrase that resonates with you.</b>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
            There's a lot of directions you can take with this question. We recommend sticking
            to just one specific word/phrase that you feel truly resonates with you, and building
            on that. Feel free to talk about your own personal experiences as to why you want to apply. 
            The stronger you can connect your word/phrase to your reason for wanting to joining BEAM, the better.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Choose a scientific concept or topic. 
                How would you explain it in a way that a K-8 school student could 
                understand? Feel free to include analogies or real-world examples!</b></p>

            Try to envision yourself actually teaching this lesson! One suggestion we have is to think about 
            any scenarios or questions that may come up with your lesson topic, and work your response to account
            for them. We know the topic you choose can be very exciting to learn, but you should try to focus on 
            <i>how</i> you'd teach this lesson, rather than telling us every intricate detail that's associated 
            with what you chose. Remember - you're teaching this to a K-8 student, not us! Being in-depth with 
            both how you'd teach it is key here.

            <span><i>200-300 words</i></span>
            -->
            <p style="text-align: left;">
            We're not trying to trick you on this one - we really want to know what you think
            makes a great mentor! A common <strong>pitfall</strong> that we see in applications
            at this stage is <i>resume dumping</i>, which is <strong>NOT</strong> what we want 
            to see. There's a difference between mentioning past experiences you've had (which we 
            love to see!), and telling us every volunteer organization you've ever been a part of. 
            Just be sure to explain why you believe the things you think make that strong
            mentor, and you'll do just fine.

                <i>You did it! We hope that wasn't so bad. We're really excited to see the fantastic work you've put into your application,
                and you should be proud for completing it! Decisions will be released on <strong>Sunday, January 28 at 8:00 AM PST.</strong></i>

  <h2 style="font-size: 2.0em; ">Frequently Asked Questions about <i>Decal</i></h2>

  <div style="width:75%; display:inline-block;">
    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>What is the weekly time commitment? </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      We have mandatory DeCal (worth 1 or 2 units) on Monday evenings from 6:30-8pm, where we primarily go over the
      lesson for the week. You will then attend site for 1 hour (not including transportation time) on one afternoon
      between Tuesday and Friday every week! You are at the same site for the whole semester. Our Outreach committee
      also plans out socials and volunteer events that you can attend on weekends!
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>What if I have no teaching experience? </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Don’t worry at all! Our Mentor Development committee prepares a Mentor Orientation every semester to prepare you
      for teaching and situations in the classroom, as well as presentations and activities throughout the semester to
      help facilitate your growth as a mentor. Additionally, you attend site in a group of 4-6 mentors, including 1
      experienced site leader so there’s people that have your back!
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>How can I get to site if I don't have a car? </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"> Transportation is entirely covered by BEAM! Some schools are within walking distance
      and transportation will be provided for those that require driving. </p>

    <p style="text-align: left; "> <b>Do I have to be a STEM major to be a mentor? </b></p>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 5vh; text-align: left;">
      Absolutely not! We have very comprehensive lesson plans that you will read every week and that we go over during
      decal on Mondays to prepare you for site.
