title: Lessons 
description: Each of our lessons is custom-designed by one of our students from the curriculum committee and undergoes feedback and testing before it is brought to site. Our lessons present to elementary and middle school students a large breadth of engineering and science topics and we continue to produce new lessons each semester. Here are some of our favorites--we invite you to witness the work that we do or to even use them for your own classroom!
